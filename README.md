# Sierpinski-Homology-Thesis-Work
This repository contains the LaTeX sources for all the work I have completed for my master's thesis. My work involves the intertwinement of fields like fractal geometry, homology theory, discrete and combinatorial computations, and the process of estimating and computing Hausdorff distances. This is also accompanied by an AI-assisted MATLAB function that discretizes the Sierpinski Gasket.
