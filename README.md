# Sierpinski-Homology-Thesis-Work
This repository contains the LaTeX and MATLAB sources for all the supplementary work I have completed for my master's thesis. My thesis work, along with the files in this repository, involves the intertwinement of fields like fractal geometry, homology theory, discrete and combinatorial computations, and the process of estimating and computing Hausdorff distances. This is also accompanied by an AI-assisted MATLAB function that discretizes the Sierpinski Gasket. The full thesis is available upon request, and to protect my work against plagiarism, the full thesis is not included here.
